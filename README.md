# Webpage of the PPP

The wepbage of the PPP is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

You can find more informations about the specific utilization of Jekyll with GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages).

## Using Jekyll locally

The following are some notes to myself to get Jekyll to work on my PC.
These are additional informations to the official Jekyll and GitHub help.

1. Have ruby, ruby-dev and nodejs packages installed.
2. When some installation does not work, try with sudo.
3. Do not forget "source 'https://rubygems.org'" in your Gemfile.
